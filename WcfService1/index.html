                It is filmed in Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, Scotland, Spain, and the United States.
                The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and its seventh season ended on August 27, 2017.

                Set on the fictional continents of <em>Westeros</em> and <em>Essos</em>, Game of Thrones has several plot lines and a large ensemble cast but centers
                on three primary story arcs. The first story arc centers on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and
                conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne.
                The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting a return to the throne.
                The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples
                and legendary creatures that lie far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.

                257 cast names were recorded. In 2014, several actor contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option,
                with raises which reportedly made them among the highest-paid performers on cable TV. In 2016, several actor contracts were again renegotiated,
                reportedly increasing the salary of five of the main cast members to £2 million per episode for the last two seasons,
                which would make them the highest paid actors on television.main cast is listed below.
